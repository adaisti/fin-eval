### Evaluation datasets for Finnish word vectors

This repository contains 3 evaluation datasets that can be used for evaluating Finnish word vectors on semantic similarity and analogy tasks. The datasets are translated from original English sources.

### Semantic similarity

The folder contains the datasets WS353 and WS277. WS353 is a complete Finnish translation of the WS353 dataset originally published by Finkelstein et al (https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=503110). WS277 is a shortened version of WS353 where word pairs with non-obvious translations are removed.

### Analogies

The dataset SSWR-fi is a shortened translation of the Semantic-Syntactic Word Relations dataset originally published by Mikolov et al (https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781). Analogy tasks and word pairs with non-obvious Finnish translations were removed in the translation process.
